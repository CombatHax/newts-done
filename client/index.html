        <p>INSTRUCTIONS: <br>
        Add force to a direction by pressing the arrow keys and press shift and the arrow key to decrease that direction<br>
        Press enter to apply the force<br>
        Press - and + to increase and decrease the mass of the object
        </p>
        <h1>THE LAWS</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>First: </strong>
            This shows Newton's first law which is that an object at rest will stay at rest and an
            object in motion will stay in motion unless acted upon by external forces. 
            <br>This shows that because the object keeps moving even when new force isn't being 
            actively applied.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Second: </strong>
            This shows Netwon's second law which is that an object's acceleration increases with
            more force and less mass.<br>This shows that because changing the increasing the mass
            will decrease the acceleration, and adding more force also increases the acceleration.
